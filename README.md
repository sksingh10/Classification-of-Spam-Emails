# Classification-of-Spam-Emails
The dataset includes a combination of "spam" and "ham" emails. Spam emails are unsolicited messages intended to sell a product or scam users into providing personal information, while ham emails represent everything that is not spam.  The language used in spam emails tends to be considerably different from typical business emails. Most spam filters leverage this difference in word frequencies to detect spam as it arrives and filter it out of email inboxes. We will use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to cluster the emails and attempt to identify groups of emails which are likely to be spam.
